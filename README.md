### Description:
This was a super fun quick project I used as an opportunity to teach myself some Typescript. I initially thought that having to define types meant using Typescript would be more work than regular Javascript but I found that I actually completed the project a lot faster than I expected because I spent less time debugging and chasing down stray errors.
Although I didn't dive too terribly deep into its capabilities, I'm excited to start using Typescript in place of Javascript when I can.
